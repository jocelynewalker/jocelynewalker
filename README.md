### Hi y'all 👋

Hi there! I'm Jocelyne, and I'm passionate about breaking down complex problems, iterating solutions, and learning along the way. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at The University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em! :metal:), and I'll be joining McKinsey & Co as a Business Analyst in Fall 2021. What excites me most is seeing "things click" and leaving the door open behind me for others to join, too. So, let's learn together! 

### Quick Facts ⏩

* LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocelynewalker/>
* Languages: Python, R, Java, HTML, SQL  
* Tools: Microsoft Office, Github, Canva, SAP, Alteryx, Tableau, PowerBI

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ☠️

So it seems as though you found my GitHub profile! That's exciting for you, and scary for me, seeing as a far amount of this profile is projects from college. No worries! Feel free to look around still - I can't stop you - but remember that **I am just a student while writing this code**. Any newer proprietary code I will not be able to share, but feel free to read the sections below on what I'm focusing on.

### Say Hi 📫

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocelynewalker/), or shoot me an email at jocelyne.v.walker@gmail.com 

I'll chat about technology, legal and ethics challenges, interviewing/resumes, Orangetheory fitness & running, baking Croatian sweets, or really whatever you want! I'm happy to share my experiences, but I'd also love to hear your journey and want to help however I can.
